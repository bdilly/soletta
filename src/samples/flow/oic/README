These examples communicate usin OIC - http://openinterconnect.org/

The OIC communication is done over IP, including 6loWPAN, Ethernet or
WiFi.

The examples rely on client and servers. Since the pairing is still
undefined and thus not implemeted, please edit a configuration file to
state your device_id in your node.

Usage example (in the same machine):
 * server:
    $ export SOL_MACHINE_ID="580a3d6a9d194a23b90a24573558d2f4"
    $ export SOL_FLOW_MODULE_RESOLVER_CONFFILE=light-server.json
    $ sol-fbp-runner light-server.fbp
 * client:
    $ export SOL_FLOW_MODULE_RESOLVER_CONFFILE=light-client.json
    $ sol-fbp-runner light-client.fbp

Server should print on console light state (it is changed by
client at each second). SOL_MACHINE_ID must match device_id set
on client configuration file.
